    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "Congratulations on finding the lane lines!  As the final step in this project, we would like you to share your thoughts on your lane finding pipeline... specifically, how could you imagine making your algorithm better / more robust?  Where will your current algorithm be likely to fail?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please add your thoughts below,  and if you're up for making your pipeline more robust, be sure to scroll down and check out the optional challenge video below!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that the problem with my pipeline is that I take the mean of the points segments that are more possible (as a feature I consider the slope) to belong the lines. A better aproach can be to minimize the square error of that possible points. Another issue is that I extend the lines to the boundaries of my ROI but I belive that it can be better to extend only to the lines, I mean where is not a curve. Depend on the lenght of the line the car may take the decision to run fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because its possible to find yellow line I decided not to use color segmentation aproach. In the future I believe that it is important to distinguish betwen types of lines. In case of using a color segmentation, I will try to use another color space or explore some adaptive segemntation to try to change lighting conditions in the image\n",
    "\n",
    "The two videos and all the images are of the same size, the lines separation seem to be similar as well as the camera. If these parameters are different it is probably that the adjustment of some parameters is going to be necessary. That is one issue in the optional challenge, the resolution of the image is different. In consecuence the ROI change and for that reason some noise is added, for example some line segments in the trees. Another problem is that part of the roadway is different in the color background. In this part is where some color discrimination could be useful.\n",
    "The front of the car is not a problem because I considered the slope of the segments to decide wich ones to be part of the lane lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have had a happy learning in this project, thank you very much.\n"
